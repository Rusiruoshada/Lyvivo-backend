
Technology StackLyvivo Backend

Overview

Lyvivo is a lightweight backend application built with TypeScript for creating a RESTful API. This backend is designed to be efficient and easy to maintain while using minimal technology and libraries to keep the setup straightforward.
Features
    TypeScript: Provides type safety and modern JavaScript features.
    REST API: Implements RESTful principles for resource management.
    Minimal Dependencies: Uses only essential libraries and frameworks for simplicity.


    TypeScript: For static typing and modern JavaScript features.
    Node.js: JavaScript runtime used for server-side logic.
    Express: Web framework for building the REST API.
    ts-node: TypeScript execution environment for Node.js.
    Jest: Testing framework (optional, if you include tests).

Installation
Prerequisites

    Node.js: Ensure Node.js is installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.

Steps

    Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lyvivo-backend.git
    cd lyvivo-backend

Install Dependencies

    npm install

Compile TypeScript

    To compile TypeScript to JavaScript, run:

        npm run build

Start the Server

    After building, start the server with:

        npm start

For development purposes, you can use ts-node to run directly without building:

    npm run dev
Usage
API Endpoints

The REST API provides the following endpoints:

    GET /api/resource: Retrieve a list of resources.
    POST /api/resource: Create a new resource.
    GET /api/resource/:id: Retrieve a specific resource by ID.
    PUT /api/resource/:id: Update a specific resource by ID.
    DELETE /api/resource/:id: Delete a specific resource by ID.

Example Request

To retrieve a list of resources:

    curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/resource

Testing

If you have included tests, you can run them using:

    npm test

Ensure you have Jest configured properly for TypeScript testing.
Configuration

Configuration settings are managed via environment variables. Create a .env file in the root directory and define the following variables:

    PORT=3000
    DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/lyvivo

Replace DATABASE_URL with the connection string to your database if applicable.
